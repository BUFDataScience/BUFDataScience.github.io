Mike Canzoneri will be presenting on git. He’ll be assuming you’re at least familiar with basic idea of git. Create a github account at least.



Also, in prep for the git presentation, please give [try.github.io](try.github.io) a go. It’s pretty decent UI practice for regular git tasks.

As the tweet below suggests merging and branching project on teams is work and takes serious thought. But it also is a major advance for managing team work.
