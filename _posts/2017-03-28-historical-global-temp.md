If youâ€™ve wondered where recently trending plots like this below come from, I did too. So I spent several months as a hobby project working through the data, the white papers, the blogs, and the code. 

Come get a high-level presentation/code talk of how to reproduce the similar graphs yourself in R with confidence and hopefully some understanding about how global temp is measured.

**For those who missed the talk, you can see the first two blog posts ([1](http://data-steve.github.io/glob-temp-data-pt1/), [2](http://data-steve.github.io/global-temp-pt2/)) in the series that made up the talk.**
