We’re back after a break

If you’ve wondered where recently trending plots like this below come from, I did too. So I spent several months as a hobby project working through the data, the white papers, the blogs, and the code. 

Come get a high-level presentation/code talk of how to reproduce the similar graphs yourself in R with confidence and hopefully some understanding about how global temp is measured.
