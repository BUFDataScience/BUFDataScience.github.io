## SQL



[Jared Majewski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-majewski-47539740) will be presenting on SQL and query optimization. He’ll be assuming you’re at least familiar with basic idea of SQL queries and will explore SQL techniques that are useful for data scientists, developers, and even database administrators.

Also, in prep for the SQL presentation, please give [SQLZOO](sqlzoo.net) a go. It’s like W3Schools for SQL.
