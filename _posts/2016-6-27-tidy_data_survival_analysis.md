# Meetup 2: Tidy Data and Survival Analysis

|    |                  |
|----|------------------|
|When: |Tues June 28 6-8pm|
|Where: |top floor of Electric Tower : (535 Washington Street, 14th Floor)|
|What: |Tidy Data and Survival Analysis|


#### Intro-level. 

Steve Simpson demo-ed/discussed the tidy data principle by Hadley Wickham. Tidy Data has been massively influential idea in data science since 80% of our time is spent tidying up messy data. 

Tidy data principles worked out 
 - [in R](https://t.co/xlT1HO5QAp)  and 
 - Python ([1](https://github.com/jfpuget/Tidy-Data/blob/master/Tidy-Data.ipynb), [2](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Tidy_Data_In_Python?lang=en)) 

Here’s some cheat sheets [for R](https://t.co/0SutUCIRyx)  and [Python](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/infographics-final.jpg) (its really tall and skinny). 

For reference: Hadley’s 3 main R packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 are the cornerstone of modern exploratory data analysis in R. The equivalent in Python is pandas by Wes McKinney (like dplyr and tidyr) and matplotlib. If you don’t know these packages, they’ve made on boarding in either language much easier. You should give them a try over at Datacamp.com, which has some really excellent free and paid tutorials in R and (now) Python. Datacamp.com's  an interactive platform like Codecademy that gives feedback on your code in the browser, so its super helpful.

#### Intermediate. 

Tom Fusillo’s leading the way with an intermediate presentation on predicting with [survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis). 

He'll discuss the fundamentals, a wee-bit of math, and then we’ll all do a toy example in Python.  I’ll try to have set-up instructions for those of you not used to Python. I’ll also try to transcribe his code for afterwards into R for R users. 

#### Application

If we have time, we’ll finish up with data-storytelling applications of how we could use data tidying skills to improve our survival analysis thru feature generation.
