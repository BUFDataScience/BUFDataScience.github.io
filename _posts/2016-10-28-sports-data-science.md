Increasingly Sports is becoming a domain where immense amounts of data are being generated for reasons as varied as big business boardroom decisions and live entertainment commentaries. 

Sports Data Science is a general interest topic with an increasingly sophisticated audience. We are excited to bring both of these together in a place like Buffalo where the fans are so avid. 




## MoneyPuck: How Analytics is Transforming the NHL

Who: Matt Busigin, CTO, Hover Networks

Sabermetrics is the data science of baseball, as epitomized in MoneyBall. "MoneyPuck" is the data science of hockey; one might call Buffalo's own version, Sabers-Metrics. 

One aspect of MoneyPuck is athlete recruitment, or prospecting. The history of prospect forecasting shows an increasing sophistication of statistical rigor. This talk will demonstrate some of that rigor, how that's affected certain teams, and discuss practical applications to Hockey enthusiasts.


## IoT Devices and Measurement of Athlete Fitness for Sports Teams

Who: Kevin Dawidowicz, President, CoachMePlus

Sports Analytics often focuses on what happens on the field, but much of the innovation in sports is being driven off the field via the utilization of IoT devices and data analytics to manage player training and health.  

The proliferation of IoT devices and the multiple health targets makes measurement as a statistical discipline increasingly important.  We will go over the myth vs the reality in the complexity of capturing new sources of data and how it helps form decisions in sports.
